    <h1>My Short Story</h1>
    <p>I am an 84-year-old gentleman who stands 5’4” tall from the basketball-crazy state of Indiana. Recently, my wife and I were having dinner at a local restaurant. Our waiter was a young man, around 6’8”. Naturally, I asked him if he played basketball. He looked down at me, replied, “Yes, I do,” and then asked me if I played miniature golf.</p>
